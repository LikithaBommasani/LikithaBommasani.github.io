# Dataset 
Source: Awesome - Datascience Github 
## URL [NYC Taxis Dataset](https://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/)
## Introduction:
This Dataset shows the data for one random NYC yellow taxi on a single day in 2013. It displays the information about where it operated, how much money it made, and how busy it was over 24 hours.
## Potential Applications and Values:
We can estimate how much revenue is generated through taxi and also approximate the busy areas within a particular time frame. This information can be used to estimate the traffic in a particular area.
# Data Science Book
## Title: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Real Life Applications

## Why it is interesting ?
This book provides insights about how Data mining can be used in the real-life applications and discusses the potential areas of application. It introduces the Data Mining and Knowledge discovery process models from the beginning like Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), I found this book very interesting as it starts from the basics and gradually covers the complex topics like data extraction concepts and related applications like Power system security analysis and Spatial meteorological patterns classification. There are topics like Automatic product classification using RFID and Data mining which are useful in the industrial management.
